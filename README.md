# CFAR100_CNN

This repository contains an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for training and evaluating a custom Convolutional Neural Network on the CIFAR-100 dataset using PyTorch.
Using only a custom Convolutional Neural Network, the model reached around 70% classification accuracy on the CIFAR-100 dataset.
